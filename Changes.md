      using 'purge all caches' will not affect the url.  Need to think of perhaps shortening the process by somehow using
      '$theme->setting_file_serve' in 'theme_shoehorn_pluginfile' of lib.php, but current process has safeguards.  However,
      this is implementation-al and should not affect 'imagebank.php' URLs.
