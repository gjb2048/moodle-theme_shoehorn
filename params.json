{"name":"Moodle-theme shoehorn","tagline":"","body":"Introduction\r\n============\r\nShoehorn theme.\r\n\r\n![image1](pix/screenshot.png \"Shoehorn screenshot\")\r\n\r\nAbout\r\n=====\r\n![image2](pix/Shoehorn_logo_sm.png \"Shoehorn logo\")\r\n * copyright  &copy; 2014-onwards G J Barnard in respect to modifications of the Bootstrap theme for Moodle.\r\n * author     G J Barnard - http://about.me/gjbarnard and http://moodle.org/user/profile.php?id=442195\r\n * author     Based on code originally written by Bas Brands, David Scotson and many other contributors.\r\n * license    http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html GNU GPL v3 or later\r\n\r\nCustomisation\r\n=============\r\nIf you like this theme and would like me to customise it, transpose functionality to another theme or build a new theme\r\nfrom scratch, then I offer competitive rates.  Please contact me via www.gjbarnard.co.uk/contact/ or gjbarnard at gmail dot com\r\nto discuss your requirements.\r\n\r\nRequired version of Moodle\r\n==========================\r\nThis version works with Moodle version 2014051200.00 release 2.7 (Build: 20140512) and above within the 2.7 branch until the\r\nnext release.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that your hardware and software complies with 'Requirements' in 'Installing Moodle' on\r\n'docs.moodle.org/27/en/Installing_Moodle'.\r\n\r\nRequired version of Bootstrap 3\r\n===============================\r\nYou will need to get and install the correct version of the parent Bootstrap theme from:\r\nhttps://moodle.org/plugins/download.php/6987/theme_bootstrap_moodle27_2014100300.zip, in order to install and use Shoehorn.\r\n\r\nI would like to thank Bas Brands and David Scotson for their work on the theme.  With a special mention to: Stuart Lamour,\r\nMark Aberdour, Paul Hibbitts and Joby Harding.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n 1. Ensure you have the version of Moodle as stated above in 'Required version of Moodle'.  This is essential as the\r\n    theme relies on underlying core code that is out of my control.\r\n 2. Login as an administrator and put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.\r\n 3. Copy the extracted 'shoehorn' folder to the '/theme/' folder.\r\n 4. Go to 'Site administration' -> 'Notifications' and follow standard the 'plugin' update notification.\r\n 5. Select as the theme for the site.\r\n 6. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.\r\n\r\nNote: If you get no CSS whatsoever, then please add the following to your Apache web server httpd.conf file after loading the modules\r\nand restart (without the ` if you see them):\r\n\r\n```\r\n<IfModule mpm_winnt_module>\r\n   ThreadStackSize 8388608\r\n</IfModule>\r\n```\r\n\r\nRef: https://github.com/bmbrands/theme_bootstrap/issues/342#issuecomment-58152495 and https://code.google.com/p/minify/issues/detail?id=62.\r\n\r\nUpgrading\r\n=========\r\n 1. Ensure you have the version of Moodle as stated above in 'Required version of Moodle'.  This is essential as the\r\n    theme relies on underlying core code that is out of my control.\r\n 2. Login as an administrator and put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.\r\n 3. Make a backup of your old 'shoehorn' folder in '/theme/' and then delete the folder.\r\n 4. Copy the replacement extracted 'shoehorn' folder to the '/theme/' folder.\r\n 5. Go to 'Site administration' -> 'Notifications' and follow standard the 'plugin' update notification.\r\n 6. If automatic 'Purge all caches' appears not to work by lack of display etc. then perform a manual 'Purge all caches'\r\n   under 'Home -> Site administration -> Development -> Purge all caches'.\r\n 7. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.\r\n\r\nUninstallation\r\n==============\r\n 1. Put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.\r\n 2. Change the theme to another theme of your choice.\r\n 3. In '/theme/' remove the folder 'shoehorn'.\r\n 4. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.\r\n\r\nReporting issues\r\n================\r\nBefore reporting an issue, please ensure that you are running the latest version for your release of Moodle.  It is essential\r\nthat you are operating the required version of Moodle as stated at the top - this is because the theme relies on core\r\nfunctionality that is out of its control.\r\n\r\nI operate a policy that I will fix all genuine issues for free.  Improvements are at my discretion.  I am happy to make bespoke\r\ncustomisations / improvements for a negotiated fee. \r\n\r\nWhen reporting an issue you can post in the theme's forum on Moodle.org (currently 'moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=46')\r\nor check the issue list https://github.com/gjb2048/moodle-theme_shoehorn/issues and if the problem does not exist, create an\r\nissue.\r\n\r\nIt is essential that you provide as much information as possible, the critical information being the contents of the theme's \r\n'version.php' file.  Other version information such as specific Moodle version, theme name and version also helps.  A screen shot\r\ncan be really useful in visualising the issue along with any files you consider to be relevant.\r\n\r\nKnown issues\r\n============\r\n1. RTL functionality is not quite ready.  In the 'General' settings there is an experimental switch 'dynamiclang' which is my first\r\n   attempt at implementing an idea as described on: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=264955.  This idea has further been\r\n   developed by me in the Essential theme: https://github.com/gjb2048/moodle-theme_essential/issues/249.  The main area of issue\r\n   has been the quiz.  Once Essential 2.7.8 is released and any other issues resolved, I will take what I have learnt there and apply\r\n   to Shoehorn.  Or it might be the case that the parent Bootstrap theme in https://github.com/bmbrands/theme_bootstrap/issues/262 will\r\n   help to resolve this.\r\n\r\nTodo\r\n====\r\n1. Consider moving fluid container setting from Bootstrap 3 settings.\r\n2. Fix D&D moving blocks into the page-bottom region and moving around not having the right width / position.\r\n\r\nVersion information\r\n===================\r\n12th October 2014 - Version 2.7.1 - First stable release.\r\n  1.

Update development to Moodle 2.7.\r\n  2.

Note:\r\n      I have decided to not introduce the icon replacement code that is in other themes for this as it is not yet\r\n      consistent with being able to replace everything due to the fixed icons in the JavaScript.\r\n 17.

Fixed user profile picture on view profile page of course participants.\r\n  6.  Fixed pop-up user message.\r\n  7.  Fixed bottom colour needing to be the footer colour and the body background the top of page for the 'navbar' by applying the\r\n      bottom footer colour to the 'html' tag.\r\n  8.

Separated out course format renderers and updated for bootstrap fix https://github.com/bmbrands/theme_bootstrap/pull/250.\r\n 11.  Created 'imagebank.php' to serve image bank images so that theme designer mode off can be used and therefore\r\n      using 'purge all caches' will not affect the url.  Need to think of perhaps shortening the process by somehow using\r\n      '$theme->setting_file_serve' in 'theme_shoehorn_pluginfile' of lib.php, but current process has safeguards.  However,\r\n      this is implementation-al and should not affect 'imagebank.php' URLs.\r\n 12.  Collapsed Topics inspired CONTRIB-4099 to look again at the course layout and fix.\r\n 13.  Bootstrap parent: https://github.com/gjb2048/theme_bootstrap/releases/tag/V2014032100_2\r\n 14.  Implemented show old messages setting I developed on: https://github.com/gjb2048/theme_bootstrap/commit/86ca17108e5f03daf9697899188dffc7f8e5b7f2\r\n\r\n 2nd April 2014 - Version 2.6.0.2 - DO NOT INSTALL ON PRODUCTION SERVERS.\r\n  1.  Bootstrap parent: https://github.com/gjb2048/theme_bootstrap/releases/tag/V2014032100\r\n  2.  Beta development version.\r\n\r\n 8th March 2014 - Version 2.6.0.1 - DO NOT INSTALL ON PRODUCTION SERVERS.\r\n  1.  Alpha development version.\r\n  2.  Dynamic social icon colour footer sign.\r\n  3.  Dynamic customisable footer menu.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n======\r\nMy thanks go to all the creators and participants of the Bootstrap theme:\r\nBas Brands, David Scotson and many other contributors.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\n\r\nBootstrap\r\n------------\r\nAuthors: Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton\r\nURL: http://getbootstrap.com/\r\nLicense: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/LICENSE\r\n\r\nBootstrap 3 for Moodle conversion\r\n------------\r\nAuthors: Bas Brands and David Scotson\r\nURL: https://github.com/bmbrands/theme_bootstrap\r\nLicense: MIT/GPL2 Licensed\r\n\r\nCourse tiles idea and initial coding\r\n------------\r\nAuthor: Jason La Greca\r\nURL: http://beenlearning.com/\r\nLicense: MIT/GPL2 Licensed\r\n\r\nBackstretch.js\r\n------------\r\nAuthor: Scott Robbin\r\nURL: http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/backstretch/\r\nLicense: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/master/LICENSE-MIT\r\n\r\nFitVid.js\r\n------------\r\nAuthors: Chris Coyier and Paravel\r\nURL: http://fitvidsjs.com/\r\nLicense: None\r\n\r\nMe\r\n==\r\nG J Barnard MSc.
