Ensure you have the version of Moodle as stated above in 'Required version of Moodle'.  This is essential as the\r\n    theme relies on underlying core code that is out of my control.\r\n 2. Login as an administrator and put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.\r\n 3. Copy the extracted 'shoehorn' folder to the '/theme/' folder.\r\n 4. Go to 'Site administration' -> 'Notifications' and follow standard the 'plugin' update notification.\r\n 5. Select as the theme for the site.\r\n 6. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.\r\n\r\nNote: If you get no CSS whatsoever, then please add the following to your Apache web server httpd.conf file after loading the modules\r\nand restart (without the ` if you see them):\r\n\r\n```\r\n<IfModule mpm_winnt_module>\r\n   ThreadStackSize 8388608\r\n</IfModule>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have created a screencast to help: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI3LsN0XwKY\r\n\r\nRef: https://github.com/bmbrands/theme_bootstrap/issues/342#issuecomment-58152495 and https://code.google.com/p/minify/issues/detail?id=62.\r\n\r\nUpgrading\r\n=========\r\n 1. Ensure you have the version of Moodle as stated above in 'Required version of Moodle'.  This is essential as the\r\n    theme relies on underlying core code that is out of my control.\r\n 2. Login as an administrator and put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.\r\n 3. Make a backup of your old 'shoehorn' folder in '/theme/' and then delete the folder.\r\n 4. Copy the replacement extracted 'shoehorn' folder to the '/theme/' folder.\r\n 5. Go to 'Site administration' -> 'Notifications' and follow standard the 'plugin' update notification.\r\n 6. If automatic 'Purge all caches' appears not to work by lack of display etc. then perform a manual 'Purge all caches'\r\n   under 'Home -> Site administration -> Development -> Purge all caches'.\r\n 7. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.\r\n\r\nUninstallation\r\n==============\r\n 1. Put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.\r\n 2. Change the theme to another theme of your choice.\r\n 3. In '/theme/' remove the folder 'shoehorn'.\r\n 4. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.\r\n\r\nVideos and FitVids\r\n==================\r\nShoehorn uses FitVids.js - http://fitvidsjs.com/ - to make embedded videos responsive.  If you do not want this feature for a particular\r\nvideo, then please add the class 'fitvidsignore' to the video element.\r\n\r\nReporting issues\r\n================\r\nBefore reporting an issue, please ensure that you are running the latest version for your release of Moodle.  It is essential\r\nthat you are operating the required version of Moodle as stated at the top - this is because the theme relies on core\r\nfunctionality that is out of its control.\r\n\r\nI operate a policy that I will fix all genuine issues for free.  Improvements are at my discretion.  I am happy to make bespoke\r\ncustomisations / improvements for a negotiated fee. \r\n\r\nWhen reporting an issue you can post in the theme's forum on Moodle.org (currently 'moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=46')\r\nor check the issue list https://github.com/gjb2048/moodle-theme_shoehorn/issues and if the problem does not exist, create an\r\nissue.\r\n\r\nIt is essential that you provide as much information as possible, the critical information being the contents of the theme's \r\n'version.php' file.  Other version information such as specific Moodle version, theme name and version also helps.  A screen shot\r\ncan be really useful in visualising the issue along with any files you consider to be relevant.\r\n\r\nCustomising the LESS\r\n====================\r\nTo help you, I have created two screen casts, one 'Production' and one 'Development'. The latter follows the former, so watch\r\n'Production' first.\r\n\r\nProduction:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uwYn2im008\r\nDevelopment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yFAS5-a3o4\r\n\r\nKnown issues\r\n============\r\n1. RTL functionality is not quite ready.  In the 'General' settings there is an experimental switch 'dynamiclang' which is my first\r\n   attempt at implementing an idea as described on: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=264955.  This idea has further been\r\n   developed by me in the Essential theme: https://github.com/gjb2048/moodle-theme_essential/issues/249.  The main area of issue\r\n   has been the quiz.  Once Essential 2.7.8 is released and any other issues resolved, I will take what I have learnt there and\r\n   apply to Shoehorn.  Or it might be the case that the parent Bootstrap theme in\r\n   https://github.com/bmbrands/theme_bootstrap/issues/262 will help to resolve this.  Update 22/4/2015: I have not forgotten about\r\n   this, but do intend in the furture to make this happen with Shoehorn.\r\n\r\nTodo\r\n====\r\n1. Consider moving fluid container setting from Bootstrap 3 settings.\r\n2. Fix D&D moving blocks into the page-bottom region and moving around not having the right width / position.\r\n\r\nVersion information\r\n===================\r\nVersion 2.8.1.1.\r\n  1.

Separated out course format renderers and updated for bootstrap fix https://github.com/bmbrands/theme_bootstrap/pull/250.\r\n 11.  Created 'imagebank.php' to serve image bank images so that theme designer mode off can be used and therefore\r\n      using 'purge all caches' will not affect the url.  Need to think of perhaps shortening the process by somehow using\r\n      '$theme->setting_file_serve' in 'theme_shoehorn_pluginfile' of lib.php, but current process has safeguards.  However,\r\n      this is implementation-al and should not affect 'imagebank.php' URLs.\r\n 12.  Collapsed Topics inspired CONTRIB-4099 to look again at the course layout and fix.\r\n 13.  Bootstrap parent: https://github.com/gjb2048/theme_bootstrap/releases/tag/V2014032100_2\r\n 14.

Bootstrap parent: https://github.com/gjb2048/theme_bootstrap/releases/tag/V2014032100\r\n  2.  Beta development version.\r\n\r\n 8th March 2014 - Version 2.6.0.1 - DO NOT INSTALL ON PRODUCTION SERVERS.\r\n  1.  Alpha development version.\r\n  2.  Dynamic social icon colour footer sign.\r\n  3.  Dynamic customisable footer menu.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n======\r\nMy thanks go to all the creators and participants of the Bootstrap theme:\r\nBas Brands, David Scotson and many other contributors.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\n\r\nBootstrap\r\n------------\r\nAuthors: Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton\r\nURL: http://getbootstrap.com/\r\nLicense: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/LICENSE\r\n\r\nBootstrap 3 for Moodle conversion\r\n------------\r\nAuthors: Bas Brands and David Scotson\r\nURL: https://github.com/bmbrands/theme_bootstrap\r\nLicense: MIT/GPL2 Licensed\r\n\r\nCourse tiles idea and initial coding\r\n------------\r\nAuthor: Jason La Greca\r\nURL: http://beenlearning.com/\r\nLicense: MIT/GPL2 Licensed\r\n\r\nBackstretch.js\r\n------------\r\nAuthor: Scott Robbin\r\nURL: http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/backstretch/\r\nLicense: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srobbin/jquery-backstretch/master/LICENSE-MIT\r\n\r\nFitVid.js\r\n------------\r\nAuthors: Chris Coyier and Paravel\r\nURL: http://fitvidsjs.com/\r\nLicense: None\r\n\r\nMe\r\n==\r\nG J Barnard MSc.
