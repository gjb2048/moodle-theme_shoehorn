Installation
============
 1. Ensure you have the version of Moodle as stated above in 'Required version of Moodle'.  This is essential as the
    theme relies on underlying core code that is out of my control.
 2. Login as an administrator and put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.
 3. Copy the extracted 'shoehorn' folder to the '/theme/' folder.
 4. Go to 'Site administration' -> 'Notifications' and follow standard the 'plugin' update notification.
 5. Select as the theme for the site.
 6. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.

Note: If you get no CSS whatsoever, then please add the following to your Apache web server httpd.conf file after loading the modules
and restart (without the ` if you see them):

```
<IfModule mpm_winnt_module>
   ThreadStackSize 8388608
</IfModule>
```

Upgrading
=========
 1. Ensure you have the version of Moodle as stated above in 'Required version of Moodle'.  This is essential as the
    theme relies on underlying core code that is out of my control.
 2. Login as an administrator and put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.
 3. Make a backup of your old 'shoehorn' folder in '/theme/' and then delete the folder.
 4. Copy the replacement extracted 'shoehorn' folder to the '/theme/' folder.
 5. Go to 'Site administration' -> 'Notifications' and follow standard the 'plugin' update notification.
 6. If automatic 'Purge all caches' appears not to work by lack of display etc. then perform a manual 'Purge all caches'
   under 'Home -> Site administration -> Development -> Purge all caches'.
 7. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.

Uninstallation
==============
 1. Put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.
 2. Change the theme to another theme of your choice.
 3. In '/theme/' remove the folder 'shoehorn'.
 4. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.

Videos and FitVids
==================
Shoehorn uses FitVids.js - http://fitvidsjs.com/ - to make embedded videos responsive.  If you do not want this feature for a particular
video, then please add the class 'fitvidsignore' to the video element.

Reporting issues
================
Before reporting an issue, please ensure that you are running the latest version for your release of Moodle.  It is essential
that you are operating the required version of Moodle as stated at the top - this is because the theme relies on core
functionality that is out of its control.

I operate a policy that I will fix all genuine issues for free.  Improvements are at my discretion.  I am happy to make bespoke
customisations / improvements for a negotiated fee. 

When reporting an issue you can post in the theme's forum on Moodle.org (currently 'moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=46')
or check the issue list https://github.com/gjb2048/moodle-theme_shoehorn/issues and if the problem does not exist, create an
issue.

It is essential that you provide as much information as possible, the critical information being the contents of the theme's 
'version.php' file.  Other version information such as specific Moodle version, theme name and version also helps.  A screen shot
can be really useful in visualising the issue along with any files you consider to be relevant.

Known issues
============
1. RTL functionality is not quite ready.  In the 'General' settings there is an experimental switch 'dynamiclang' which is my first
   attempt at implementing an idea as described on: https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=264955.  This idea has further been
   developed by me in the Essential theme: https://github.com/gjb2048/moodle-theme_essential/issues/249.  The main area of issue
   has been the quiz.  Once Essential 2.7.8 is released and any other issues resolved, I will take what I have learnt there and apply
   to Shoehorn.  Or it might be the case that the parent Bootstrap theme in https://github.com/bmbrands/theme_bootstrap/issues/262 will
   help to resolve this.

Todo
====
1. Consider moving fluid container setting from Bootstrap 3 settings.
2. Fix D&D moving blocks into the page-bottom region and moving around not having the right width / position.

5th May 2014 - Version 2.6.0.3 - DO NOT INSTALL ON PRODUCTION SERVERS.

  2.  Fixed enrolment button not showing background colour.
  3.  Fixed search box and icon at the top of forums.
  4.  Fixed hover over messages in message drop-down.
  5.  Fixed user profile picture on view profile page of course participants.
  6.  Fixed pop-up user message.
  7.  Fixed bottom colour needing to be the footer colour and the body background the top of page for the 'navbar' by applying the
      bottom footer colour to the 'html' tag.
  8.  Fixed validator links to be inline in page info section with dividers.
  9.  Added favicon.
 10.  Separated out course format renderers and updated for bootstrap fix https://github.com/bmbrands/theme_bootstrap/pull/250.
 11.  Created 'imagebank.php' to serve image bank images so that theme designer mode off can be used and therefore
      using 'purge all caches' will not affect the url.  Need to think of perhaps shortening the process by somehow using
      '$theme->setting_file_serve' in 'theme_shoehorn_pluginfile' of lib.php, but current process has safeguards.  However,
      this is implementation-al and should not affect 'imagebank.php' URLs.
 12.  Collapsed Topics inspired CONTRIB-4099 to look again at the course layout and fix.
 13.  Bootstrap parent: https://github.com/gjb2048/theme_bootstrap/releases/tag/V2014032100_2
 14.  Implemented show old messages setting I developed on: https://github.com/gjb2048/theme_bootstrap/commit/86ca17108e5f03daf9697899188dffc7f8e5b7f2
