The "Shoebrush" Moodle Theme
======================
Shoebrush is a basic child theme of Shoehorn to help you as a theme developer create your own child theme of Shoehorn.

Shoebrush is provided 'AS IS' so that you may learn from it and use it as the starting point of your child.  If you want to change
the name of this theme, then follow the standard procedure for cloning a theme: https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Cloning_a_theme.

You MUST have 'Shoehorn' installed for this child theme to work.  The 'version.php' file contains the correct 'required' dependent
version of 'Shoehorn'.

Required version of Moodle
==========================
This version works with Moodle version 2015051100.00 release 2.9 (Build: 20150511) and above within the 2.9 branch until the
next release.

Please ensure that your hardware and software complies with 'Requirements' in 'Installing Moodle' on
'docs.moodle.org/29/en/Installing_Moodle'.

Installation
============
 1. Ensure you have the version of Moodle as stated above in 'Required version of Moodle'.  This is essential as the
    theme relies on underlying core code that is out of my control.
 2. Login as an administrator and put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.
 3. Copy the 'shoebrush' folder to the '/theme/' folder.
 4. Go to 'Site administration' -> 'Notifications' and follow standard the 'plugin' update notification.
 5. Select as the theme for the site.
 6. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.

Upgrading
=========
 1. Ensure you have the version of Moodle as stated above in 'Required version of Moodle'.  This is essential as the
    theme relies on underlying core code that is out of my control.
 2. Login as an administrator and put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.
 3. Make a backup of your old 'shoebrush' folder in '/theme/' and then delete the folder.
 4. Copy the replacement extracted 'shoebrush' folder to the '/theme/' folder.
 5. Go to 'Site administration' -> 'Notifications' and follow standard the 'plugin' update notification.
 6. If automatic 'Purge all caches' appears not to work by lack of display etc. then perform a manual 'Purge all caches'
    under 'Home -> Site administration -> Development -> Purge all caches'.
 7. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.

Uninstallation
==============
 1. Put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.
 2. Change the theme to another theme of your choice.
 3. In '/theme/' remove the folder 'shoebrush'.
 4. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.

Downgrading
===========
If for any reason you wish to downgrade to a previous version of the theme (unsupported) then this procedure will inform you of how to
do so:
1.  Ensure that you have a copy of the existing and older replacement theme files.
2.  Put Moodle into 'Maintenance mode' under 'Home -> Administration -> Site administration -> Server -> Maintenance mode', so that there
    are no users using it bar you as the administrator.
3.  Switch to a core theme, 'Clean' for example, under 'Home -> Administration -> Site administration -> Appearance -> Themes ->
    Theme selector -> Default'.
4.  In '/theme/' remove the folder 'shoebrush' i.e. ALL of the contents - this is VITAL.
5.  Put in the replacement 'shoebrush' folder into '/theme/'.
6.  In the database, remove the row with the 'plugin' of 'theme_shoebrush' and 'name' of 'version' in the 'config_plugins' table, then
    in the 'config' table find the 'name' with the value 'allversionhash' and clear its 'value' field.  Perform a 'Purge all caches'
    under 'Home -> Site administration -> Development -> Purge all caches'.
7.  Go back in as an administrator and follow standard the 'plugin' update notification.  If needed, go to
    'Site administration' -> 'Notifications' if this does not happen.
8.  Switch the theme back to 'Shoebrush' under 'Home -> Administration -> Site administration -> Appearance -> Themes -> Theme selector ->
    Default'.
9.  Put Moodle out of 'Maintenance mode' under 'Home -> Administration -> Site administration -> Server -> Maintenance mode'.

Reporting issues
================
Before reporting an issue, please ensure that you are running the latest version for your release of Moodle.  It is essential
that you are operating the required version of Moodle as stated at the top - this is because the theme relies on core
functionality that is out of its control.

When reporting an issue you can post in the theme's forum on Moodle.org (currently 'moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=46')
or check the issue list https://github.com/gjb2048/moodle-theme_shoehorn/issues and if the problem does not exist, create an
issue.

It is essential that you provide as much information as possible, the critical information being the contents of the theme's 
'version.php' file.  Other version information such as specific Moodle version, theme name and version also helps.  A screen shot
can be really useful in visualising the issue along with any files you consider to be relevant.
